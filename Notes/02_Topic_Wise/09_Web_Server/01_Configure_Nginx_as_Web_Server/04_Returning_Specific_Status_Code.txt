*) Returnig cific Status Code:
	-> https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/web-server/#returning-specific-status-codes

	-> Some website URIs require immediate return of a response with a specific error or redirect code, for example when a page has been moved temporarily or permanently. The easiest way to do this is to use the return directive. For example:
		location /wrong/url {
		    return 404;
		}

	-> The first parameter of return is a response code. The optional second parameter can be the URL of a redirect (for codes 301, 302, 303, and 307) or the text to return in the response body. For example:
		location /permanently/moved/url {
		    return 301 http://www.example.com/moved/here;
		}

	-> The 'return' directive can be included in both the location and server contexts.
